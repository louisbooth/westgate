      <p><b><u>About Us</u></b><br>The Westgate Community Farm is a 1 acre urban farm serving the Westgate neighborhood of West Palm Beach. Westgate Community Farm is a productive farm while also demonstrating how to grow a wide range of fruits, vegetables and herbs organically in South Florida.  We offer community garden plots, education programs, and a lush community green space for all to explore and enjoy. Resident participation is encouraged in all aspects of the farm.  The farm hosts two weekly markets on site at the farm as well as a mobile market that brings produce from the farm to residents' doorsteps.  This project is funded by the <a href="https://www.westgatecra.org" target=" ">Westgate Community Redevelopment Agency</a>.
      <p><b><u>Mission</u></b><br>The Westgate Community Farm improves access to fresh, affordable produce in the neighborhood and provides meaningful educational opportunities on the farm for people of all ages.</p>
      <p><b><u>Westgate Community</u></b><br>The Westgate neighborhood was developed in 1921 as the most western gateway into the City of West Palm Beach and stands as one of the oldest platted subdivisions in Palm Beach County. The area was de-annexed from the City of West Palm Beach in 1931 and has remained unincorporated since. With a 2014 population of 11,433, Westgate is approximately 2 square miles bounded by Okeechobee Blvd to the north, Belvedere Road to the south, N. Military Trail to the west and Florida Mango Road to the east. <br><br>In the 29 years since its creation, the Westgate Community Redevelopment Agency has worked to promote social and economic development and implement the goals and objectives of its 1989 and 2005 Community Redevelopment Plans. The Westgate CRA was created with the primary objective of improving public infrastructure, essential to stimulate redevelopment and set a foundation for quality development. By leveraging CRA increment revenue with local, state and federal grant funding, over $30 million in sanitary sewer, drainage, roadway and flood mitigation infrastructure improvements, and $6.2 million in new affordable housing construction and rehabilitation projects were completed throughout residential CRA neighborhoods since 1992. The Westgate Community Farm and the Westgate Greenmarket Express are among the CRA's notable community- centered rehabilitation projects.</p>
      <p><b><u>Farming Practices</u></b><br>At our farm we grow fruits and vegetables without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or fungicides. We believe that healthy food begins with healthy soil. We nourish the soil, adding organic material and utilizing sustainable growing techniques such as cover cropping, crop rotation, mulching and companion planting. We prepare the soil for planting using a walk- behind tiller and a small 1940â€™s Ford tractor but the majority of the farm work we do by hand, such as weeding, seeding, planting, harvesting, raking the beds before planting, fertilizing, picking off harmful insects and mulching.</p>
      <p><b><u>Location</u></b><br>1130 Wabasso Drive<br>West Palm Beach, FL 33409<br>
        (The entrance to the farm is on Genessee Ave and the entrance to the market is on Wabasso Drive. There is plentiful on- street parking on Genessee Ave.)</p>
